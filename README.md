![Ui](docs/images/Ui.png)

**ClinicAssistant is a desktop app for managing contacts**, optimized for use via a Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you can type fast, ClinicAssistant can get your contact management tasks done *faster than traditional GUI apps.*
